# Bookkeeping

* Questions about git?

---

# What is computer science?

* Computer science exists independently of computers
* Anything can be a computer
* The first computers were people
* Charles Babbage basically created computers because he kept finding errors in _The Nautical Almanac_
* A computer just follows directions very, very well
* In a world where computers exist, this gives rise to a bunch of other stuff (information theory, cryptography, Minecraft, etc)

---

# Is this class computer science?

* Well yes, but actually no
* We will cover practical applications of computer science at an **extremely high level** only
* We will _not_ learn:
  * How to sort a linked list
  * What polymorphism is
  * The difference between covariance and contravariance

---

# How does code work?

* Computers are very dumb
* Traditionally, a processor only knows a few _instructions_, which are just things you can tell the CPU to do
  * For example: add, clear, compare, decrement, increment, jump, load, store, transfer
  * Modern processors have a wild number of instructions, like special instructions just for decoding video fast
* Humans are bad at writing machine instructions (aka assembly)
* Humans are worse at _reading_ machine instructions
* Humans are okay at writing _high-level_ code
* A _compiler_ is a special computer program that turns code into instructions

---

# Compilation example

* [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org)
* A simple C program:

```
int square(int num) {
    return num * num;
}
```

* Becomes this:

```
push    rbp
  mov     rbp, rsp
  mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-4], edi
  mov     eax, DWORD PTR [rbp-4]
  imul    eax, eax
  pop     rbp
  ret
```

---

# Some things are kind of wild

* Running compiled code is risky if you don't know what will do
* It's pretty hard to know what code will do before you run it (see the Halting Problem)
* At the same time, every processor has a slightly different instruction set
  * Mobile phones made this more of a challenge
  * Phones use special processors designed to use less energy (ARM)
* So, instead of running machine code, you might download the code, and your computer compiles it while you use the program
  * This is called just-in-time compilation
  * Android apps do this kind of sometimes maybe
  * iOS apps do not do this, usually

---

# Anyway, here's type theory

* When you write code, you deal with a lot of _types_
* A _type_ is just a classification of the way values are stored
* Some common types:
  * Boolean (true or false)
  * Integer (whole numbers)
  * Float (floating point numbers or fractions)
  * String (just text)
* Sometimes, you will need to make your own type
* Some languages will let you mix up types, like JavaScript
* Some languages will not even let you run the program if your types are messed up

---

# Assigning values

* It is very common to use a _variable_ to hold on to some data
* In order to put the data in a variable, we _assign_ it

```
var x = 1;
```

* In this JavaScript example, we use `var` to say we're creating a new variable
* Then we provide a name for the variable, in this case just `x`
  * `x` is actually a terrible variable name
  * Clear variable names make your code easier to read!
* Finally we define the data to go into this variable, the number `1`
* Later on, we don't need to use `var` because the variable is already created

```
x = 2;
```

* Now, `x` is storing the number `2`

---

# Functions

* It's helpful to put a bunch of code together into a `function`
* We saw an example of this earlier, here it is in JavaScript

```
function square(num) {
    return num * num;
}
```

* The word `function` is how you start a new function
* You _usually_ have to give your function a name (in this case, `square`)
* Inside parentheses, you put the inputs (parameters) for your function
  * In this function, it takes one value, called `num`
  * In JavaScript, you don't have to say what kind of type you expect
  * Pro: this makes it quicker to write code
  * Con: this makes it hard to understand what type this function _should_ take
* Then we use brackets to define where the function starts and ends
* For the sake of argument, functions only return one value

---

# More about functions

```
function square(num) {
    return num * num;
}
```

* Inside of brackets is the _body_ of the function
* This is where the function does stuff
* When the function is done, we can use `return` to spit a value back out of it
* This function will take one input number, multiply that number by itself, and return the result
* You can then _call_ this function elsewhere in the code and `assign` the _returned_ value to a variable

```
var x = 2;
var y = square(x);
```

* What number is stored in `y`?

---

# Modifying values

* Once you've assigned a value to the variable, you can read or modify that value
* Continuing the previous example:

```
console.log(y);
```

* `console.log` is a built-in _function_ that comes with JavaScript (basically)
* It just prints something to a place where you can see it
* We _pass_ `y` as a _parameter_ to this function, and the function will _read_ that value
* We can also modify the value in `y`:

```
y = y + 3;
```

* What is the value in `y` now?

---

# Branching logic

* The most common way to control the flow of your app is with `if` statements
* In the following example, notice that we enclose strings in double quotes

```
if (true) {
  console.log("it is true");
} else {
  console.log("it is false");
}
```

* What will this print?
* This is in JavaScript, notice that boolean values are written as either `true` or `false`

---

# Comparison

* Since `true` is always `true`, the previous example always does the same thing
* Let's do someting more complicated

```
var x = 5;
var y = 10;

if (y > x) {
  console.log("yeah that makes sense");
} else if (y < -1) {
  console.log("not sure how this happened");
} else if (x == y) {
  console.log("this seems impossible");
}
```

* You can compare numbers with `<`, `>`, or `==`
* Very important: assignment is `=` but comparison is `==`

---

# Examples of types

* These are all in JavaScript
* Anything after `//` will be ignored; we use these to write comments

```
var integer = 37;                // creates an integer
var someFloat = 3.1415926535;    // creates a floating-point number
var text = "my name is the dog"; // creates a string
var yes = true;                  // creates a boolean
```

* Sometimes we want to have a bunch of data in a list
* Most languages call this an _array_
* In JavaScript, you use square brackets to start and end an array

```
var myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]; // creates an array of integers
myArray.append(7);                // add a new number to the end of the array
var thirdNumber = myArray[2];     // read the 3rd number in the array
```

* Don't worry about memorizing these, they're just examples and we'll go into much more detail with all of these later

---

# Review and summary

* Computers are very dumb
* They can only do a few things but they will do those things perfectly and very fast and forever
* In order to write code that is easier to understand we build on layers of abstraction and use a compiler to turn that code into machine instructions
* High-level code is mainly comprised of variables, assignment, modification, functions, and control flow
* All of the programming languages we will use in this class are fairly similar
* What we discussed today will largely hold true for the entire semester
