# Web Frameworks

* Webpack, NPM, and Vue
* Vue lets us update our webpage without a ton of hassle
* Webpack makes our site easy to deliver to users
* NPM gives us code written by a bunch of people that is generally good

# HTML and Semantic Markup

---

# What is HTML?

* Hyper Text Markup Language
  * Tim Berners-Lee
  * CERN
  * 1990
* Didn't get images until 1993
* Extremely fragmented
  * Openly developed
  * Browsers kind of did whatever
  * Servers just kind of send text and hope for the best
  * That's how Marc Andreessen added the <img> tag to Mosaic
* HTML5 from 2008 - 2014

---

# Bad HTML

```html
<html>
  <head>...</head>
  <body>
    <div class="button">Click me!</div>
    <div class="menu">
      <div class="first-option">Home</div>
      <div class="second-option">About</div>
      <div class="third-option">Resources</div>
      <div class="fourth-option">Help</div>
    </div>
    This text is <b>important</b>, is it more <i>than this</i>?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <div class="reallybig">ABOUT US</div>
    This is a whole different paragraph.
    <br/>
  </body>
</html>
```

---

# Better HTML

```html
<html>
  <head>...</head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <button>Click me!</button>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li>Home</li>
          <li>About</li>
          <li>Resources</li>
          <li>Help</li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>
    <main>
      <p>This text is <em>important</em>, is it more <strong>than this</strong>?</p>
      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>This is a whole different paragraph.</p>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

# All HTML Pages Should

* Have exactly one `header` tag
* Have exactly one `main` tag
  * Usually... there are exceptions
* Have exactly one `footer` tag
* Have at most one `nav` tag
* Avoid non-semantic markup
  * `b`, `i`, `blink`, `banner`, `marquee`
* Make sense without any CSS at all
  * Even on mobile
* Work well with accessibility features
  * Use `a` tags for links, `button` tags for buttons
* Avoid interfering with browser behavior
* Not cheat (invisible images, tables)

---

# HTML Tag Cheat Sheet

* `header`
* `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`
* `nav`
* Lists
  * `ol`
  * `ul`
  * `li`
* `main`
* `p`
* `span`
* `footer`

# Assignment

* Semantically mark up one page from your design
* Probably the "main" page
* Text only for now: don't worry about images
* A user should know how to use your site from this markup alone... mostly
* What is style, or merely presentation information?
* Put this outside of your Vue div (with id="app") for now
  * Or, just remove the Vue div; note that Vue might complain in the JavaScript console, though
