# Errata

* Balance your brackets (e.g. `[ ... ]`, `( ... )`, `{ ... }`)
* Attendance
* Grades
* Weather

---

# HTML

* It's kind of a hack
* It's a miracle it works at all
* The tech industry has spent $Texas making it work
* I hope you made it good

# CSS and Styling Your Content

---

# What is CSS?

* Cascading Style Sheets
* A set of rules for styling your content
* Styles applied to
  * tags (`p`, `a`, `button`, `span`)
  * Classes e.g. `<span class="henlo">lizard</span>`
  * IDs e.g. `<div id="app">My app</div>`
    * Try not to do this
* In theory, a common ruleset that neatly makes your semantic HTML pretty
* In practice, a mess of "why isn't this centered"

---

# Webpack and CSS

* We have to do a few things
* First, add CSS and style loaders

```bash
npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader
```

* Second, we need a Webpack config
  * Wait, I thought Webpack had a zero config option?
  * Yes, you were lied to

---

# Webpack Setup

[github.com/steverichey/im361](https://github.com/steverichey/im361) -> [Web project setup, part2](https://github.com/steverichey/im361/blob/master/web-setup.md#im-361-web-project-setup-part-2)

```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'main.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist')
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: [
          'style-loader',
          'css-loader'
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

webpack.config.js

---

# More Webpack stuff

* Add a src/style.css file

```css
* {
  color: red;
}
```

Make this change to your package.json file:

```js
"scripts": {
  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
  "dev": "webpack --mode development"
}
```

Add import `"./style.css";` to the top of your index.js

---

# Build our new site

* With the style/CSS loader, Webpack can bundle our CSS in the page neatly
* With the development flag, our JavaScript is a bit easier to read
* Now you can run `npm run dev`
* Open your page in the browser

# New terminal stuff

Warnings went away
CSS got bundled

# Neat, everything is red

---

# Mess with your CSS

* Selectors
  * `html` or `body`
  * `a`, `li`, `ul`, `button`, `p`, `span`, `h1`, `header`, `main`, `footer`
  * Classes (you have to add these)
    * `<span class="applebees">Bappleees</span>`
    * Dot prefix
* Pseudo-classes like `a:hover`
* Properties
* width, font-size, color, float
* Values
* px, %, em, vw, vh
* Don't forget to use `npm run dev` after changes
* Make üëè your üëè site üëè ugly

# Assignment

* Style your HTML
* Don't worry about animations or anything that "seems complex"
* Just try to get stuff in the right place and the right color
* One page only; just use the HTML from last time
* Good resources:
* [cssreference.io](https://cssreference.io/)
* [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
* [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)
* [Mozilla Developer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
