# HTML and Vue

* HTML: neat at rendering static content
* Vue: neat at updating HTML
  * If you're modifying elements manually, you're doing it wrong
  * Try to write as little JavaScript as possible

# Tying It All Together: Part Two

---

# CSS and Vue

* Styles defined by CSS can be applied automagically
* Vue can toggle CSS classes based on binding
* When CSS classes are changed, any animation parameters are applied
* I really cannot overstate how much of a pain this was to do before we had modern web frameworks

---

# CSS Animations 1

```css
@keyframes fadein {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }

  to {
    opacity: inherit;
  }
}

.animated {
  animation-duration: 3s;
  animation-name: fadein;
}
```

---

# CSS Animations 2

```html
<!-- First page -->
<main v-bind:hidden="pageName != 'home'" class="animated">
  ...
</main>
```

---

# CSS Animations 2b

---

# CSS Animations 3

```css
@keyframes spin {
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }

  50% {
    transform: rotate(180deg);
  }

  to {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
}

p:hover {
  animation: 3s infinite alternate spin;
}
```

# CSS Animations 4

---

# CSS Transitions

```css
.canShowError {
  transition: color 1s, background-color 2s, border 3s;
}

.canShowError.hasError {
  background-color: red;
  color: white;
  font-weight: bold;
  border: 2px dashed yellow;
}
```

---

# CSS Transitions 2

Make sure your Vue data has an isError property

```html
<button
  v-on:click="isError = !isError"
  v-bind:disabled="isButtonDisabled">
  ERROR is {{ isError ? "ON" : "OFF" }}
</button>

...

<p
  class="canShowError"
  v-bind:class="{ hasError: isError }">
  ...
</p>
```

# Web fonts

* Google Fonts
  * Technically another URL request
  * Pretty fast though
  * No one actually knows why Google offers these fonts "for free"
* Files included in your Webpack module
  * Won't work locally unless you start a server
  * A bit of a pain to set up
  * Licensing

---

# Google Fonts

* [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com/)
* Add to "cart"
* Google gives you the CSS

# Google Fonts CSS

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Miss+Fajardose');

.fancy {
  font-family: 'Miss Fajardose', cursive;
}
```

# Webpack Fonts

* Have to add a file-loader NPM package
* Webpack will then handle font files in source directories
  * This could be src, fonts, whatevs
* CSS can then reference font via @font-face
* JS can reference font with import (as with our CSS)
* Paths become.... messy
  * 07592f3c41d6b637f5a8245052beda97.ttf
  * This is actually good for browser caching IIRC
  * Should we use dist? src? None? JS wants one thing, CSS wants another, Webpack seems to want neither
* Encoding becomes messier
  * Literally the entire font is turned into a base64 JS string
  * Adds 50kb to the font???? Why??
* Let's not

---

# Assignment

* Add some fancy CSS
* Control that CSS in some way from Vue
* Try to find a natural fit for your web app
* Focus on what you'll need to finish between now and March 4, when the full project is due

---
