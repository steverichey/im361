# About

* In place of this week's Wednesday class, please work through this lesson.
* Follow along with your own Android Studio project.
* Next week, we'll set everyone up to run this code.
* Enjoy!

---

# Android Layouts

* Instead of using HTML and CSS to layout content, Android uses XML files
* Android Studio generated one for you at `res/layout/activity_main.xml`
* Nearly every layout file you create will have backing code

---

# Interactivity in Android

* Instead of defining logic using JavaScript, Android uses Java or Kotlin
* The build pipeline can do some magic to connect our layout to our logic
* However, as you'll see, we need to ensure a few things first

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

# View your layout

Double-click `app -> res -> layout -> activity_main.xml` from the project view on the left.

You can shrink the bottom view by pressing the minus button on the right side.

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/layouts-2.png)

# View your code

Double-click `app -> java -> [your package name] -> MainActivity` from the project view on the left.

---

# Adding interactivity

* So far your activity only has a text field, so let's add a button.
* Add the following lines of code immediately below `setContentView(R.layout.activity_main)`

```kotlin
var myText: TextView = findViewById(R.id.my_text_view)
var myButton: Button = findViewById(R.id.my_button)
myButton.setOnClickListener {
    myText.text = "I've been clicked!"
}
```

* Notice that we no longer need semicolons at the end of each line; Kotlin doesn't use them
* Also, we have to define the "type" of most things we create; sometimes, Kotlin can figure out the type
* Here we find two items in our layout, and set the button to update the text when clicked

---

# Android Studio is angry

We couldn't run this code, because the compiler can't find `Button` or `TextView`, and it can't find the IDs we used.

This is the double-edged sword of build-time checking; let's fix this!

---

# Adding imports

* In order for our code to "know" about types, they have to be imported
* This is similar to how we imported Vue in our JavaScript
* Add the following lines of code immediately below `import android.os.Bundle`

```kotlin
import android.widget.Button
import android.widget.TextView
```

* Android Studio will do this for you if you press Option+Enter when the blue popup appears

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

# Still kinda mad tho

Android Studio is less angry, but is still highlighting our IDs in red. Let's fix that.

---

# Adding IDs to our layout

* Our code (in `MainActivity`) needs to be able to find our UI elements (in `activity_main`)
* To do this, we set an ID on each UI element
* This is pretty similar to IDs in JavaScript (we didn't use those much in Vue, though)
* Save, then open `activity_main.xml`
* If you're not in the design view, click the "Design" tab on the bottom-left of the editor view
* Click on `TextView - "Hello World!"` in the `Component Tree`
* On the top-right, you can enter an ID under `Attributes`
* Enter `my_text_view` in that field, and save

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/layouts-5.png)

# After entering an ID

Now, return to `MainActivity`

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/layouts-6.png)

# Slightly less angry

The text view ID is no longer red, but the button still won't work. Let's fix that.

Return to `activity_main.xml`

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/layouts-7.png)

# Adding a button, 1

Under "Palette" select "Buttons" and then select "Button".

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/layouts-8.png)

# Adding a button, 2

Drag the button into the layout

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/layouts-9.png)

# Adding a button, 3

Now the button shows up under "Component Tree".

---

# Setting a button ID

* Just like the text view, we can add an ID to our button
* Under `Attributes` enter `my_button` in the ID field
* Android Studio might have set a default there, just replace it

---

# Constraints

* You may have noticed that there's a red icon next to your button in the "Component Tree".
* This is because Android doesn't know where to put your button when it lays out your activity.
* There are several ways to define position in Android
* Your activity was set up to use a contraint layout, so let's use that for now.

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/layouts-10.png)

# Constraints, 2

Click each of these plus icons

In each box that appears, you can set a number for how far away it should be from the next closest thing

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/layouts-11.png)

# Contraints, 3

I just put zero in each, so the button will be equally distant from all neighbors

Note that in one direction, the neighbor is the text view, but the other directions are the activity

The red icon is now a yellow icon; we'll fix that later.

---

# Now we're happy

There's still more to do, but that's good enough for now.

# Assignment

* After working through this lesson, commit your changes and push up your code.
* For full credit, make sure you don't have any red text, red underlines, or other errors.
* Next time, we'll resolve warnings, and actually run our code.
