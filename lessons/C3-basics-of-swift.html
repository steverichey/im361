# View controller

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    @IBOutlet weak var button: UIButton!

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    }
}
```

---

# Adding a function

* Add the following:

```swift
override func shouldPerformSegue(withIdentifier identifier: String, sender: Any?) -> Bool {
}
```

* Add below the viewDidLoad closing brace
* You should get autocomplete
* This will get called by iOS before a segue
* You have to return true (should perform) or false (should not perform)

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

# Swift switch statements

Kind of like a lot if if-then statements

If you don't provide cases, you'll get this error

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-2.png)

# Switch cases

Since `identifier` is a string, cases must be strings

Every case must have a statement

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-3.png)

# Exhaustive switches

Swift switches have to handle all possibilities

You can use a default case for this

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-4.png)

# Default case

We only have one segue, and we can give it this ID

So while we know that default is unnecessary, Swift doesn't

This also helps if you add identifiers later

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-5.png)

# Returning values

We've done this before

If you see an arrow at the end, you need to return

"Should perform" indicates what to return

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-6.png)

# Unresolved identifiers

We want to allow "greenView" segue in only some cases

We haven't added that yet, or we misspelled it

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-7.png)

# Swift compiler errors

Also available in the left pane, in the issue navigator

Warnings also show up here

---

# Updated view controller

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    @IBOutlet weak var button: UIButton!
    var isSegueAllowed = false

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        // Do any additional setup after loading the view.
    }

    override func shouldPerformSegue(withIdentifier identifier: String, sender: Any?) -> Bool {
        switch identifier {
        case "greenView":
            print("going to the green view")

            if isSegueAllowed {
                return true
            } else {
                return false
            }
        default:
            print("going to some other view?")
            return true
        }
    }
}
```

# Switch component

Can trigger a function when toggled

Good for changing a boolean value

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-8b.gif)

# Adding a switch

Drag from "value changed" to your class

Give your method a name e.g. `didPressSwitch`

---

# Implementing the switch

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController {
    @IBOutlet weak var button: UIButton!
    var isSegueAllowed = false

    // ...

    @IBAction func didPressSwitch(_ sender: Any) {
        isSegueAllowed = !isSegueAllowed
    }
}
```

# Naming our segue

Useful when one view controller has many segues

Click on the segue itself

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-10.png)

# Debugging your app

Bottom pane shows `print` statements

This shouldn't be called? What gives

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-11.png)

# Fixing the typo

The compiler doesn't check our storyboards

It's up to you to make sure things are right

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-12.png)

# Dismissing the view

We still get stuck on the second view

Let's add a button to return to the previous view

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-13.png)

# Adding a second view controller

We need code to dismiss the view

Right-click the folder containing code and add a file

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-14.png)

# Add a new Swift file

Ensure iOS tab is selected

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-15.png)

# Name your file

SomethingViewController.swift

Should be in the same folder as the other view controller

---

# A new view controller

* Add this code:

```swift
import UIKit

class GreenViewController: UIViewController {
    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
    }
}
```

* UIKit is needed for a view controller
* viewDidLoad is a good place to set up your view

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-16.png)

# Linking the class

Select the view controller in question

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-17.png)

# Custom class

Enter your class name in this field

Xcode should offer autofill

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-18.png)

# Custom class added

Should show this module

Name of the scene changes too

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-19.png)

# Creating an IBOutlet

Sometimes Xcode gets stuck like this...

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-20.png)

# Automatic assistant

Automatic will usually pick the right thing

If not, you can pick from "manual"

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-21.png)

# Insert button action

"Touch up inside" is standard for buttons

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-22.png)

# Creating the action

Give it a name

For iOS, this is usually `didPressSomething`

---

# Dismissing the view

* Change this:

```swift
@IBAction func didPressGoBack(_ sender: Any) {
}
```

* To this:

```swift
@IBAction func didPressGoBack(_ sender: Any) {
    dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
}
```

* Swift function parameters have names

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

# Displaying an alert

Add a new button

Connect a "Touch up inside" action to a view controller

---

# Implementing an alert

```swift
@IBAction func didPressShowAlert(_ sender: Any) {
    // create the alert controller
    let alert = UIAlertController(title: "Hello world!", message: "This is an alert", preferredStyle: .alert)

    // create a default action
    let action1 = UIAlertAction(title: "Hello", style: .default) { _ in
        // this code will be run when the user picks "Hello"
        print("Hello was clicked")
    }

    // create a cancel action
    let action2 = UIAlertAction(title: "Cancel", style: .cancel) { _ in
        // this code will be run when the user picks "Cancel"
        print("action was cancelled")
    }

    // create a destructive action
    let action3 = UIAlertAction(title: "DELETE", style: .destructive) { _ in
        // this code will be run when the user picks "DELETE"
        print("DELETE WAS CLICKED")
    }

    // add all actions to the alert
    alert.addAction(action1)
    alert.addAction(action2)
    alert.addAction(action3)

    // show the alert to the user
    present(alert, animated: true) {
        // this code will run after the alert is shown
        print("alert was shown")
    }
}
```

---

# Implementing an alert

```swift
// create the alert controller
let alert = UIAlertController(title: "Hello world!",
                              message: "This is an alert",
                              preferredStyle: .alert)
```

---

# Implementing an alert

```swift
// create a default action
let action1 = UIAlertAction(title: "Hello",
                            style: .default) { _ in
    // this code will be run when the user picks "Hello"
    print("Hello was clicked")
}
```

---

# Implementing an alert

```swift
// create a cancel action
let action2 = UIAlertAction(title: "Cancel",
                            style: .cancel) { _ in
    // this code will be run when the user picks "Cancel"
    print("action was cancelled")
}
```

---

# Implementing an alert

```swift
// create a destructive action
let action3 = UIAlertAction(title: "DELETE",
                            style: .destructive) { _ in
    // this code will be run when the user picks "DELETE"
    print("DELETE WAS CLICKED")
}
```

---

# Implementing an alert

```swift
// add all actions to the alert
alert.addAction(action1)
alert.addAction(action2)
alert.addAction(action3)
```

---

# Implementing an alert

```swift
// show the alert to the user
present(alert,
        animated: true) {
    // this code will run after the alert is shown
    print("alert was shown")
}
```

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-32.png)

# Example alert

Preferred style is alert

Normal, destructive, and cancel action styles

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-33.png)

# Example action sheet

A bit more particular on iPad

If tapped away, "cancel" is assumed

You can't tap away from an alert

---

# Swift arrays

```swift
let array1 = [
    1,
    2,
    3,
    4,
    5
]

let array2 = [
    "first",
    "second",
    "third",
    "fourth",
    "fifth"
]
```

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-24.png)

# Heterogeneous collections

Everything in a Swift array has to be the same type

You'll get this kind of warning if it gets confused

---

# Swift structs

```swift
struct Planet {
    let name: String
    let position: Int
    let distanceFromSun: Float
    let diameter: Float
    let orbitalVelocity: Float
    let rotationalVelocity: Float
}
```

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-30a.png)

# Image views

Drag an image view from the library into a view

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-30b.png)

# Default appearance

No image yet

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-30c.png)

# Select your assets

Currently, only an app icon

This is where your image resources go

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-30d.png)

# Click the plus button

Select "New Image Set"

Rename the default image

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-30e.png)

# Adding resources

Typically, three images with @1x, @2x, and @3x suffixes

Use highest resolution for 3x, then 66% and 33%

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-30f.png)

# Selecting our image

Enter the exact resource name in the Attributes Inspector

---

class: center, middle, imgresize

![](../images/swift-30g.png)

# Image added

Try "Content Mode" to set fill

Otherwise, use constraints to set size

---

# Assignment

* Add view controllers for all your scenes
* Make sure the view controller is properly connected
* Ensure your code compiles and your app runs without crashing
* Use at least one of any other thing we covered
  * Switch statement
  * Struct
  * Image view
  * Alert
  * Conditional segues
  * Array
  * Dismissing a view
