## Overview

Development techniques and practices for websites and mobile application user interfaces and experiences. The course will be taught through lectures, demonstrations, and exercises using applications and scripting languages. Hands-on work will be required during class as well as considerable out of class production time.

## Resources

Please note that all required software will be discussed in class, including the installation process. Xcode is only available on macOS, so any student using a non-Apple computer will need to have access to an Apple computer during the final project of the course.

* Personal computer, per the Interactive Media department's [laptop requirement](https://www.bradley.edu/academic/departments/interactive/laptop/)
* Terminal program
* Text editor: BBEdit/TextWrangler, [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), Emacs, [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com)
* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode)

Please note that while this course does not require a vast amount of technical expertise, it is expected that some technical issues may arise during the class. Students are recommended to leverage the [Technology HelpDesk](https://www.bradley.edu/sites/helpdesk/), their fellow students, and the instructor when issues arise and _before_ any technical issues prevent a student from submitting course work on time. Generally speaking, late work due to technical problems will not be accepted.

## Topics

## Accommodation

In accordance with University procedures, any student who feels they may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact me privately to discuss your specific needs. Students requesting accommodations must register with [Student Access Services](https://www.bradley.edu/offices/student/sas/) located at 100 Heitz Hall and provide appropriate documentation to verify eligibility. You can reach the SAS at (309) 677-3654 or find more information at the Student Access Services website.

## Academic Honesty

Academic dishonesty is a serious offense and will not be tolerated within this class and within the Department of Interactive Media. Any student found plagiarizing will receive a grade of “0” for the assignment and will be subject to disciplinary action under Bradley regulations. Plagiarizing on the final exam/project will render you an F for the course.

Please note it is your responsibility as a student to understand what collaboration is, what the limits are, and to contact me if you are ever in doubt. Independent work is critical to the learning process. Please review your Student Handbook for more information.

## Late Work

Late work will not be accepted. Submission times will be checked to make sure that assignments were received prior to the due date. Work turned in after the posted day will result in a zero. The instructor reserves the right to make exceptions under documented extenuating circumstances.

## Goals and Objectives

This course is designed to present some of the basic skills necessary to develop user interfaces and experiences utilizing various applications and languages. As a result of successful completion of this course, learners will demonstrate some the following knowledge, skills, and dispositions.

* Develop mobile-first websites using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript
* Leverage modern site development technologies like Webpack and Vue
* Leverage open source solutions using package management tools
* Develop mobile applications for Android writing Kotlin and Java in Android Studio
* Leverage web APIs for mobile applications
* Leverage device sensors to enhance mobile applications
* Develop mobile applications for iOS writing Swift and Objective-C in Xcode
* Leverage UI tools to create resolution-independent interfaces
* Leverage testing frameworks to ensure code runs as expected

## Participation and Professionalism

You can only be successful in this class if you participate and engage in the material. Participation and professionalism points are taken into consideration for individual grades (see rubrics for respective assignments). Lack of participation and professionalism may reduce your grade.

## Social Media and Classroom Distractions

It is considered professional etiquette when in a meeting to turn off your phone and give full attention to the subject being discussed. Students in this course are expected to do the same. If you text, use Facebook, email, etc., the instructor reserves the right to ask students engaged in this type of behavior to leave the class. It is then the student’s responsibility to make up any lost or missing work from the class dismissal. Lack of professionalism by engagement in social media during class will reduce your grade.

## Course Assessment

Projects will be graded based on their adherence to specific criteria as well as their effectiveness. Sakai will be used for grades in accordance with University policy. Most coursework will be handled via GitHub; some coursework may be submitted via Sakai.

| Letter | Meaning   | Percent     | Info                                                                 |
| ------ | --------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A      | Excellent | ≥ 90%       | Superior competence and performance far beyond minimum requirements. |
| B      | Good      | <90%, ≥ 80% | Above average competence and fulfills beyond minimum.                |
| C      | Average   | <80%, ≥ 70% | Average competence and meets minimum requirements.                   |
| D      | Deficient | <70%, ≥ 60% | Deficient competence and partially fulfills minimum requirements.    |
| F      | Failing   | <60%        | Minimal competence with material and minimum requirements not met.   |

## Student Privacy

The [Department of Interactive Media](https://www.bradley.edu/academic/departments/interactive/) has a policy to protect student privacy and in accordance with the [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act](https://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html). Questions and concerns regarding grades must be presented in person or in a written letter. Because of this policy, I will not respond to questions and concerns communicated through email or telephone calls regarding grades. Additionally, I will not speak to you about your individual grades in the presence of other students.

We treat our students as adults, and as such, my Department Chair and I are available to discuss issues regarding your grades or classroom policies with you. Due to FERPA, faculty and staff cannot comment on any student records without a legal release, including with your parents.

Note that communicating about problems directly with us enables your growth and maturity. Regardless, my course of action when I receive an email from your parents is:

1. I will forward the email to you with this: “I received the attached email from your parent/caregiver/other. I will not be responding to this email due to federal regulations and my strongly held belief that this does not help you in any way. If you have questions about the course, please see me during my office hours or email me back to arrange an appointment.”
1. I will cc the email that I forward to you to your parents and to my Department chair.
1. I will not take any further course of action.

## Attendance

Class attendance, learning, and letter grades are positively correlated. Unexcused absences may result in a zero for the week's work. Repeated unexcused absences may result in letter grade reductions for the project or entire course.

## Excused Absence

Students are responsible for providing satisfactory evidence to the instructor to substantiate the reason for absence. Except in the case of the observance of a religious holiday, to be excused the student must notify his or her instructor in writing (acknowledged e-mail message is acceptable) prior to the date of absence if such notification is feasible. In cases where advance notification is not feasible (e.g. accident, or emergency) the student must provide notification by the end of the second working day after the absence. This notification should include an explanation of why notice could not be sent prior to the class. Accommodations sought for absences due to the observance of a religious holiday can be sought prior to the absence.

If needed, the student must provide additional documentation substantiating the reason for the absence to the satisfaction of the instructor, within one week of the last date of the absence.

If the absence is excused, the instructor must either provide the student an opportunity to make up any quiz, exam or other work that contributes to the final grade or provide a satisfactory alternative by a date agreed upon by the student and instructor. If an instructor has a regularly scheduled make up exam, students are expected to attend unless they have a university-approved excuse. The make-up work must be completed in a timeframe not to exceed 7 calendar days from the last day of the initial absence.

The instructor is under no obligation to provide an opportunity for the student to make up work missed because of an unexcused absence.

Whenever a student is absent for unknown reasons for an extended period of time, the instructor will initiate a check on the welfare of the student by reporting through the Department of Interactive Media Chair or designee of the Slane College of Communications and Fine Arts.

Among the reasons absences are considered excused by the instructor are the following:

* Death or major illness in a student’s immediate family. Immediate family may include:  mother, father, sister, brother, grandparents, spouse, child, spouse’s child, spouse’s parents, spouse’s grandparents, stepmother, step-father, step-sister, step-brother, step-grandparents, grandchild, step-grandchild, legal guardian, and others as deemed appropriate by faculty member or student’s academic Dean or designee.
* Illness of a dependent family member.
* Participation in legal proceedings or administrative procedures that require a student’s presence.
* Religious holy day.
* Student injury or illness that is serious enough for a student to be absent from class requires confirmation. Illness confirmation may be obtained by one or both of the following methods:
* Confirmation by the University’s Student Health Center or Student Services.
* Confirmation of visit to a healthcare professional affirming date and time of visit.
* An absence for a non-acute medical service does not constitute an excused absence.
* Required participation in military duties.
* Mandatory admission interviews for professional or graduate school that cannot be rescheduled.
* Mandatory participation as a student-athlete in NCAA-sanctioned competition.
* Other reason deemed appropriate by the student's instructor.

## Video Game Addiction

Video game addiction is one of our vocational hazards. If you are finding that video games are interfering with your ability to do your work or maintain your social life, please get in touch with the professor. Some signs of video game addiction are:

* Playing in secret or lying about how long he or she has been playing
* Mulling over video games when engrossed in other activities
* Sacrificing time at work or school in order to play
* Using games to escape from reality
* Anxiety or depression
* Becoming alienated from friends and family
* Becoming irritated if unable to play
* Lacking enough hours of sleep
* Losing interest in other activities and hobbies
* Increasingly ignoring personal hygiene

## Sexual Misconduct Reporting Resolution

Bradley University faculty are committed to supporting students and upholding the University's non-discrimination policy. Under Title IX, discrimination based upon sex and gender is prohibited. If you experience an incident of sex- or gender-based discrimination, we encourage you to report it. While you may talk to a faculty member, understand that as a _Responsible Employee_ of the College the faculty member MUST report to the college's Title IX Coordinator what you share. If you would like to speak with someone who may be able to afford you privacy or confidentiality, there are people who can meet with you. Faculty can help direct you or you may refer to [Bradley's Sexual Misconduct Policy](http://www.bradley.edu/campuslife/studenthandbook/policies/misconduct/index.dot). You do not have to go through the experience alone.
